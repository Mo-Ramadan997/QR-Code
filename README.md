  <div class="contaner">
    <div class="imag">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code " />
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
      <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

```css
